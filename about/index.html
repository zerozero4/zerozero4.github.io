I am zerozero4.</p> <h2 id="-education"># Education</h2> <p>I graduated my high school in the year 2020. I spent the next few months preparing for <strong>JEE Main</strong> &amp; <strong>JEE Advanced</strong> and secured <strong>AIR 3412</strong>. I got opprotunities to get by bachelor’s degree in one of the reputed colleges of India.</p> <p>But I refused as I cannot get a degree in Computer Scienece / IT. So I went with state counselling and am currenly persuing by Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology @ <a href="https://mitindia.edu">Anna University, MIT Campus, Tamil Nade, India</a>.</p> <h2 id="-interests"># Interests</h2> <p>I had this fire to develops games ever since my childhood. One of the most fascinating things that I ever came across in my life was the <strong>Level Creator in Battle City (NES)</strong> which led me down the path of game development.</p> <p>Then I studied lot of math and started to have a pick for procedural generation and their applications in games. Obviously, <em>Mincecraft</em> was the first thing I came across.</p> <p>I also like web-development. Infact, HTML was the first “language” (not a “programming language”) I learnt.</p> <h2 id="-currently"># Currently,</h2> <p>I am trying to do my best as a college student and learn as much as possible before I graduate. I am working on a game engine called <a href="https://github.com/zerozero4/arc-engine">ARC Engine</a> which I have set as my long term goal.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class = 'footer'> <p class="row"> © 2021 <span title="All Rights Reserved"> All Rights Reserved </span> </p> </div> </div> </div> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lozad.js/1.0.8/lozad.min.js" integrity="sha512-Nt+V5JYamXCSvlHzNVleriGhTrolnfxckJ8sEXxv/BJ0tKV1HyPDXH+bIFNcUJ5hcthQ95uAeU2JClPT16mFyg==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script> </body> </html>
